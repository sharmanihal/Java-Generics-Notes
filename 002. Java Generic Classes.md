### Generic Class

A generic class in Java is a class that can operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety. It allows the type of the class to be specified using a type parameter, usually represented by a single uppercase letter like T (Type), E (Element), K (Key), or V (Value).

Generics provide the ability to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with any data type while ensuring that type consistency is enforced at compile-time.

**Basic Structure of a Generic Class**

A generic class is defined with a type parameter in angle brackets <T>. This type parameter can then be used throughout the class for fields, method parameters, and return types.
```
// Defining a simple generic class
public class Box<T> {
    private T content; // T represents the type of the content

    public void setContent(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
```
In the above example:

Box<T> is a generic class where T is a placeholder for the type of the content.

The type parameter T is used to specify the type of the instance variable content, the parameter of the method setContent(), and the return type of the method getContent().


**Example Usage of a Generic Class**

Here’s how you can create instances of a generic class with different types:
```
public class GenericClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a Box to store an Integer
        Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
        integerBox.setContent(123);
        System.out.println("Integer content: " + integerBox.getContent());

        // Creating a Box to store a String
        Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
        stringBox.setContent("Hello, Generics!");
        System.out.println("String content: " + stringBox.getContent());
    }
}
```
**Explanation**

1. Box<Integer> creates an instance of Box where T is replaced with Integer. This means that the content variable will be of type Integer, and only integers can be stored in it.


2. Box<String> creates another instance where T is replaced with String. Now, content will be of type String, and only strings can be stored in it.


3. The type safety is guaranteed at compile-time, preventing adding a value of the wrong type.



**Advantages of Generic Classes**

**Type Safety:** Generics ensure that the code can only use objects of the specified type, reducing the risk of ClassCastException at runtime.

**Code Reusability:** The same class can work with different data types without the need for duplication.

**Readability and Maintainability:** Code becomes easier to understand and maintain, as it is clear what types are expected.


Generics make it easier to create type-safe and reusable classes by enabling parameterization of types.

### Another Example to make things even more clearer:

A simple example of a generic Pair<K, V> class in Java would involve using two type parameters, K (for Key) and V (for Value). This allows you to create a class that can hold a pair of related objects of different types.

Example of a Generic Pair<K, V> Class

Here is how you can define a basic Pair class:
```
// Generic Pair class
public class Pair<K, V> {
    private K key;
    private V value;

    public Pair(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public K getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public V getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setKey(K key) {
        this.key = key;
    }

    public void setValue(V value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
```
**In this example:**

- K represents the type of the key, and V represents the type of the value.

- The class has a constructor to initialize the key and value.

- Getter and setter methods are provided for both the key and value.


**Example Usage of the Pair Class**

Here’s how you can use the Pair class to create pairs of different types:
```
public class PairExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a Pair of Integer and String
        Pair<Integer, String> pair1 = new Pair<>(1, "One");
        System.out.println("Key: " + pair1.getKey() + ", Value: " + pair1.getValue());

        // Creating a Pair of String and Double
        Pair<String, Double> pair2 = new Pair<>("Price", 99.99);
        System.out.println("Key: " + pair2.getKey() + ", Value: " + pair2.getValue());
    }
}
```
**Explanation**

1. Pair<Integer, String> pair1 creates a pair where the key is an Integer and the value is a String. In this case, the key is 1 and the value is "One".


2. Pair<String, Double> pair2 creates another pair where the key is a String and the value is a Double. Here, the key is "Price" and the value is 99.99.


3. The generic Pair class allows you to create pairs of any type while maintaining type safety.



**Output**
```
Key: 1, Value: One
Key: Price, Value: 99.99
```

The Pair<K, V> class provides a flexible and type-safe way to work with pairs of related objects, making it a common utility in generic programming.
